The Madagascar king was furious with the leprechaun that had summoned
a fat dragon that stole his precious princess to the end of the rainbow.
But the king was also a greedy king that didn't want to lose a good soldier.
So he summoned Guybrush Threepwood to his majestic hut and demanded him
to kill the annoying dragon.

The lazy king threw Guybrush his wooden leaning stick and said it was the
"Sword of Thousand Truths". He didn't really put much effort in this at all...

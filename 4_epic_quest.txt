The Madagascar king was furious with the leprechaun that had summoned
a fat dragon that stole his precious princess to the end of the rainbow. 
But the king was also a greedy king that didn't want to lose a good soldier. 
So he summoned Guybrush Threepwood to his majestic hut and demanded him 
to kill the annoying dragon.

The king threw Guybrush a stick that was laying on the floor in his hut 
and said it was the "Swoooord of Thoooousand Truthssssss!". He didn't really put much effort in this at all...

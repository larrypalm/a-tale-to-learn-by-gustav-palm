Guybrush returns to Madagaskar with the head of the fat dragon which he presents to the king.
The only problem was that the "sword" that the king gave to Guybrush, 
was in fact the leprechauns poor snake. 
Whilst casually leaning to the stiff snake, Guybrush accidently
squeezed his hand to the pointy fangs. The lethal venom went fast to his heart and put him in a coma. And they all lived happily ever after.

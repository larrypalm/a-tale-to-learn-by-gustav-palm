The villain was no less than the infamous leprechaun Dark Helmet who somehow could control fat dragons.

Dark Helmet not only has in his possession a dark helmet, he also has the legendary stick of mind control.
The stick wasn't accually a stick. It was the leprechauns very old snake that suffered from major arthritis problems.
